<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a Bachelors student at <a href="http://www.en.sharif.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Sharif University of technology</a> <a href="http://ce.sharif.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Computer Science &amp; Engineering Department</a> and research assistant in both Aalto University and Max-Planck Institute of Informatics. I have been pursuing my career and studies in fields related to computer science.
My topics of interest involve applying topics in optimization, algorithm engineering, stochastic algorithm design, and statistics, and I have decent familiarity and experience with data science and machine learning; specifically applications of deep learning in computational biology.
</p>
<p>As a person who has participated in multiple competitive programming contests as a high school student, I have accumulated much experience in the basics of creative algorithm design and have pursued computer science ever since. As of recent years, I have specialized in research and participated in two major projects revolving around the aforementioned topics of interest.
</p>
<h2>Research Experience</h2>
<p>I am currently researching on two topics:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><b>RNA inverse folding using Graph Neural Networks</b>: Our team tries to design an RNA sequence that folds into a certain given secondary structure. The problem of RNA sequence design is of crucial importance in bio-engineering. The problem is also known as RNA inverse folding we have tried to achieve results via a data-driven approach. I have started this research recently as a summer intern under the supervision of <a href="https://people.aalto.fi/pekka.orponen" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Pekka Orponen</a>. The topic involves a baseline familiarity of RNA structures and an in-depth understanding of Graph Neural Network architectures and machine learning basics.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Semi-Definite Programming using a natural dynamic known as the Slime Mold</b>: We have proposed a new algorithm inspired by a natural dynamic that is able to solve positive linear programs. I have started my research on this in 2020 under the supervision of <a href="https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~karrenba/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Andreas Karrenbauer</a> and published a paper <a href="https://www.google.com/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>here</a>. The topic involves advanced linear algebra as well as a good understanding of dynamical systems and convex optimization.
</p>

<p>You may find more detailed information about my research <a href="research.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Honors and Awards</h2>
<p>I have a rich background in Competitive Programming as well as theoretical Computer Science. Participating in many algorithmic contests as a high school student and first-year college undergraduate, I have achieved two national Olympiad medals and have received many other awards:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://icpc.sharif.edu/2018/scoreboard/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Gold Medal at ACM-ICPC regional contests</a> 
</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://apio2018.ru/results/official-contest/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Bronze medal at Asia-Pasific Informatics Olympiad (APIO 2019)</a> (<a href="./docs/apio-certificate.png" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>certificate</a>)
</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.info1cup.com/archive/2018/International_Round_Ranking.pdf" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Gold medal at InfoCup 2019</a> (<a href="./docs/infocup-certificate.png" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>certificate</a>)
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Iranian National Olympiad in Informatics Gold Medal (INOI 2018)
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Iranian National Olympiad in Informatics Silver Medal (INOI 2017)
