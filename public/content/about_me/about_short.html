            Full-time machine learning researcher with a recent M.Sc. degree from the <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/" class="special-hyperref">University of Toronto</a> 
            and currently a scientist at <a href="https://layer6.ai/" class="special-hyperref">Layer 6 AI.</a> My research focuses on deep generative models, understanding
             them through the lens of the manifold hypothesis, and enhance their robustness through this understanding. Recently, I have also been exploring the use of prior fitted networks to develop transformer-based models for tabular data.
