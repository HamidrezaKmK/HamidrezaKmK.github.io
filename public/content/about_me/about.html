        as a Machine Learning Scientist, delving deep into the reliability of generative models. Specifically, I am
        looking at pathological behaviours that modern generative models exhibit from a <strong>Manifold Learning
            Theory</strong> perspective when they are employed on Out-of-Distribution data in the wild.</p><br />
    <p>As a competitive programmer passionate about computer science theory and practice, I prioritize integrating top
        engineering practices. Recognizing the dynamic nature of machine learning research, I create libraries in my
        free time to support researchers and work on projects aimed at bridging the gap between abstract concepts of
        machine learning with real-world applications in computer vision, healthcare, and computational biology.</p>
