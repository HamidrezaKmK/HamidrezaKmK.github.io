    <p>Machine learning scientist and researcher at <a href="https://layer6.ai/" class="special-hyperref">Layer6 AI</a> and a recent
        <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/" class="special-hyperref"> University of Toronto M.Sc.</a> graduate in the department of computer science.</p><br />
    <p>Previously, I have worked with Rahul Krishnan on linking causality with generative models, and recently with Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem on
        exploring deep generative models through the lens of manifold hypothesis.</p>
    <p>My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and computer science theory.</p>
    <!-- <p>My main research area is exploring deep generative models from a fundamental perspective with a special focus on statistical foundations. </p>
    <p>As a competitive programmer passionate about computer science theory and practice, I prioritize integrating top
        engineering practices. Recognizing the dynamic nature of machine learning research, I create libraries in my
        free time to support researchers and work on projects aimed at bridging the gap between abstract concepts of
        machine learning with real-world applications in computer vision, healthcare, and computational biology.</p> -->
