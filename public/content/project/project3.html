    <p>This is an indie self-developed project to simplify the ML operations needed for developing an ML model. The
        framework currently only focuses on the developmental stage of ML operations and is a lightweight package to
        create ML experiments, store and manage experiment configurations, hyperparameter tuning. One unique aspect of
        this project is its caching capabilities. Caching is done at the software level and one can use this package to
        work with any remote server. For example, by combining ML-Mnemonist with a Google Colab environment, you do not
        need to worry anymore about losing your progress when the session crashes or gets disconnected for any reason.
