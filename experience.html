<h1>Experience</h1>
</div>
<p>In the last year of my higher secondary education, before graduating from high school, I started teaching as a part-time career for two years. For the most part, I taught high school students who were enthusiastic about topics in computer science and competitive programming. In turn, as a former national Olympiad in Informatics gold medal, I gained valuable experience communicating with students and preparing competitive programming contests for them. Consequently, this led me to choose Computer Science &amp; Engineering as my major field of study in the university. Additionally, I was chosen as an official member of the National Olympiad in Informatics committee helping students in my home country to study computer science, and as a side-work created many online content and courses in this regard.
</p>
<p>During my academic studies, I tried out working as technical staff in a couple of events during my first year and had the opportunity to work with many faculty members of my home university as a teaching assistant in courses such as algorithms and data structures; probabilities, and statistics; artificial intelligence.
</p>
<p>Gravitated towards more specialized topics, I chose to continue my career as a research assistant in places such as Aalto and Max Planck Institute of Informatics as a summer intern. Through the last year and a half, my main concentration was my research projects, and have gained fruitful experience working with researchers around the world.
