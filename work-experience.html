<h1>Work Experience</h1>
</div>
<p>In the last year of my higher secondary education, before graduating from high school, I started teaching as a part-time career for two years. For the most part, I taught high school students who were enthusiastic about topics in computer science and competitive programming. In turn, as a former national Olympiad in Informatics gold medal, I gained valuable experience communicating with students and preparing competitive programming contests for them. Consequently, this led me to choose Computer Science &amp; Engineering as my major field of study at the university. Additionally, I was chosen as an official member of the National Olympiad in Informatics committee helping students in my home country to study computer science, and as a side-work created many online content and courses in this regard.
</p>
<p>Additionally, I started working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Fanap company in Iran. During my work, I gained valuable insights into the industry and worked on an AI-based computer vision project which honed my technical expertise in developing and deploying machine learning models.

  Computer-aided diagnosis has become widespread in dental applications and with the advent of data-driven approaches in dealing with radiographic images, machine learning models are being deployed 
  in order to help dentists in the visual representation of images as well as aiding them in their diagnosis process. During my experience with Fanap, I experimented with U-Net type architectures for
  panoramic dental image correction and tooth segmentation based upon Mask-RCNN type architectures. Our results demonstrate our capabilities 
  in restoring super exposed dental images and also the ability to accurately segment teeth and dental augmentations performed on the patient.
