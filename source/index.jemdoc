== About Me

Delving into the nexus of machine learning fundamentals, focusing on AI reliability, explainability, and their ties to statistical foundations.

Currently, I am interning at [https://layer6.ai/ *Layer6 AI*] as a Machine Learning Scientist, delving deep into the reliability of generative models.
Specifically, I am looking at pathological behaviours that modern generative models exhibit from a *Manifold Learning Theory* perspective when they are employed on Out-of-Distribution data in the wild.

As a competitive programmer passionate about computer science theory and practice, I prioritize integrating top engineering practices. 
Recognizing the dynamic nature of machine learning research, I create libraries in my free time to support researchers and work on projects aimed at bridging the gap between abstract concepts of machine learning with real-world applications 
in computer vision, healthcare, and computational biology.

  <strong> Explaining a Popular Paradox in Deep Generative Models </strong> - <em> <a href="https://layer6.ai/">Layer6 AI</a> - Toronto, Canada </em>

  <p>
  We examine the paradox of deep generative models assigning high likelihoods to unseen data and propose a method to improve their reliability and theoretical understanding in out-of-distribution detection.

  Introduced a novel neural network architecture that can learn to understand the underlying structure of the data-generating process. This ultimately
  helps us produce reliable and explainable models that can account for interventional distributions unseen in the training data. [<a href="https://github.com/vahidzee/ocdaf">Code</a>] [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07480">Paper</a>]

  Thesis leveraged attention mechanisms in deep learning to identify synergistic drug combinations for cancer research. 
  Achieved a 1.5x accuracy boost in dose response prediction for the NCI-ALMANAC cancer drug database.

  Designing beneficial RNA structures is challenging in biotechnology. 
  We use reinforcement learning algorithms combined with graph neural networks to model and design RNA sequences, 
  obtaining previously underexplored structures like RNA pseudo-knots.

  <p>
  Inspired by the optimization dynamics of slime molds in nature, 
  developed a mathematical dynamic that provably converges to the optimal solution for semi-definite programming problems.
