== About Me

An M.Sc. student delving into the nexus of machine learning fundamentals, focusing on AI reliability, explainability, and their ties to statistical foundations.

Currently, I am interning at [https://layer6.ai/ *Layer6 AI*] as a Machine Learning Scientist, delving deep into the reliability of generative models.
Specifically, I am looking at pathological behaviours that modern generative models exhibit when they are employed on Out-of-Distribution data that they
have not seen before. Additionally, explaining such behaviours using a *Manifold Learning Theory* perspective fascinates me.

As a competitive programmer with a zest for both the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science, I am always vigilant about integrating the best engineering practices in my work.
My industry tenure as a Machine Learning Engineer has enriched my perspective, marrying theory with real-world applicability. 
The engineering aspects of machine learning research are challenging as they involve continuous development of a codebase that might change drastically due to the inherent nature of research. 
Therefore, in my free time, I enjoy thinking about and implementing new libraries that help research scientists in their research journey as well as seamlessly blending abstract concepts with real-world applications.

  Introduced a novel neural network architecture that can learn to understand the underlying structure of the data-generating process. This ultimately
  helps us produce reliable and explainable models that can account for interventional distributions unseen in the training data. [<a href="https://github.com/vahidzee/ocdaf">Code</a>] [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07480">Paper</a>]

  Designing beneficial RNA structures is challenging in biotechnology. 
  We use reinforcement learning algorithms combined with graph neural networks to model and design RNA sequences, 
  obtaining previously underexplored structures like RNA pseudo-knots.
