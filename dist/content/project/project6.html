    <p>RNA is one of the major classes of information-carrying biopolymers in the cell of living organisms and recent
        studies revealed a key role in regulatory processes and transcription control, which have also been connected to
        certain diseases. Therefore, the engineering of RNA molecules is of growing importance with applications ranging
        from biotechnology and medicine to synthetic biology. The functional properties of RNA are derived from their
        secondary structure. Given a secondary structure, we aim to predict sequences that fold into a target minimum
        free energy secondary structure, while considering various constraints. This problem, known as <strong>RNA
            Inverse Folding or RNA Sequence Design</strong>, can be regarded as a combinatorial optimization problem and
        in our work, we aim to solve this using a data-driven approach.</p><img src="/project6.png"

    <p>Specifically, we present a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based model that learns an autoregressive decomposition of
        the distribution of nucleotides given a certain secondary structure. The structure is embedded using our GNN and
        by carefully sampling from this generative model we can obtain the correct solution to the RNA inverse folding
        problem. Our model, while still improving, has proven to yield good results on RNA inverse folding datasets such
        as <em>PseudoBase+++, Rfam-Tenda, and Eterna100</em>.</p>
