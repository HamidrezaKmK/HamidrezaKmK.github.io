    <p>Physarum Polycephalum is a slime mold that can solve shortest path problems. A mathematical model based on
        Physarum's behavior, known as the Physarum Directed Dynamics, can solve positive linear programs. In this paper,
        we present a family of Physarum-based dynamics extending the previous work and introduce a new algorithm to
        solve positive Semi-Definite Programs (SDP). The Physarum dynamics are governed by orthogonal projections
        (w.r.t. time-dependent scalar products) on the affine subspace defined by the linear constraints. We present a
        natural generalization of the scalar products used in the LP case to the matrix space for SDPs, which boils down
        to the linear case when all matrices in the SDP are diagonal, thus, representing an LP.</p><br /><img

    <p>We investigate the behavior of the induced dynamics theoretically and experimentally, highlight challenges
        arising from the non-commutative nature of matrix products, and prove soundness and convergence under mild
        conditions. Moreover, we consider a more abstract view of the dynamics that suggests a slight variation to
        guarantee unconditional soundness and convergence-to-optimality. By simulating these dynamics using suitable
        discretizations, one obtains numerical algorithms for solving positive SDPs, which have applications in discrete
        optimization, e.g., for computing the Goemans-Williamson approximation for MaxCut or the Lovasz theta number for
        determining the clique/chromatic number in perfect graphs.</p>
