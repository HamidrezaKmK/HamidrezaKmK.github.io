    <p>Combination therapies have emerged as a powerful treatment modality to overcome drug resistance and improve
        treatment efficacy. However, the rapid increase of drug combinations with the number of individual drugs in
        consideration has led to in Silico simulations becoming widespread. While many studies are only able to find
        synergistic pairs of drugs, our method which is named DeepDDR obtains the full dose–response matrices of
        different drug tuples which enables finding the optimal dose required for many applications. Additionally, this
        approach offers a more in-depth view of the drugs’ complex response landscape, and allows to calculate different
        synergy metrics as a follow-up step.</p><br /><img src="/project1.png"

    <p>From a technical perspective, DeepDDR facilitates Graph Neural Networks and multi-head attention with the goal of
        identifying the most effective drug combinations for further pre-clinical and clinincal validation. In this
        work, we propose a general recipe for devising Deep Neural Network architectures that can predict dose responses
        for multiple drugs on a specific cell-line. In our opinion, this framework can inspire future work to create new
        models and further address the drug-dose response problem. Graph Neural Networks and Attention-based models have
        emerged as powerful machine learning tools in many applications; therefore, we incorporate popular architectures
        in the domain to obtain latent embeddings of drug compounds and combine cell-line features with these
        embeddings. That being said, while previous work on drug-dose response considers MACCS fingerprints to represent
        drug compounds, we follow the trend of using Graph Neural Networks on SMILES notations of compounds to produce
        more accurate embeddings of drugs. These embeddings can take into account the structure of the compound as a
        whole. Finally, our findings indicate that using DeepDDR yields state-of-the art results on the comprehensive
        drug-dose-response NCI-ALMANAC dataset which contains drug pair dose responses on popular human cancer
        cell-lines.</p>
