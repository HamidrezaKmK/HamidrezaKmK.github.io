    <p>Computer-aided diagnosis has become widespread in dental applications and with the advent of data-driven
        approaches in dealing with radiographic images, machine learning models are being deployed in order to help
        dentists in the visual representation of images as well as aiding them in their diagnosis process. During my
        experience with Fanap, I experimented with U-Net type architectures for panoramic dental image correction and
        tooth segmentation based upon Mask-RCNN type architectures. Our results, demonstrate our capabilities in
        restoring super exposed dental images and also the ability to accurately segment teeth and dental augmentations
        performed on the patient.</p><br /><img src="/project4.png"
