        Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/" class="special-hyperref">Electrical Engineering
            and Computer Science (EECS) program at MIT</a> and a CSAIL affiliate,
        working under the supervision of <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/" class="special-hyperref">Prof.
            Justin Solomon.</a> Previously, I completed my Master's in
        <a href="https://web.cs.toronto.edu/" , class="special-hyperref">Computer Science at the University of
            Toronto </a> and spent over a year working as a machine learning scientist
        at <a href="https://layer6.ai/" class="special-hyperref">Layer 6.</a>

        My research focuses on deep generative models, understanding the geometric behavior of data through the
        lens of these models, and using these insights to improve model performance.
        Additionally, I have experience in causal inference, in-context learning, and tabular predictive
        modeling.
        </br>
        Outside of research, I enjoy gaming, hiking, and a good round of competitive programming with friends.
