            I am a computer scientist at heart, with a Gold medal from the national Olympiad in Informatics and accolades from the ACM-ICPC under my belt. However, while 
            I began with algorithm design and competitive programming during high school and undergraduate years, I have since transitioned 
            into a full-time machine learning researcher, specializing in <strong> deep generative models.</strong>
            During my masterâ€™s program, supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/" class="special-hyperref">Rahul Krishnan,</a> I focused on 
            applying generative models for causal discovery, addressing out-of-distribution generalization, and identifying failure modes in deep generative models when 
            confronted with unseen data. Currently, I am taking a more theoretical view of deep generative models, particularly exploring them through the lens of the 
            <strong> manifold hypothesis,</strong>
            in collaboration with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/gabriel-loaiza-ganem/about-me" class="special-hyperref">Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem.</a>

            While generative modeling remains my primary area of focus, I have recently taken a strong interest in investigating transformer-based <strong> tabular foundation models </strong> through Prior Fitted Networks (PFNs). 
            I have also had the rewarding opportunity to mentor students at the 
            <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/" class="special-hyperref">Vector Institute</a> and the University of Toronto, guiding them in applying these models to causal inference.
